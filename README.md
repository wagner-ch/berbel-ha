## üì± Usage Examples

### Basic Fan Control
```yaml
# Turn fan on (level 1)
service: fan.turn_on
target:
  entity_id: fan.berbel_fan

# Set specific speed (33% = level 1, 66% = level 2, 100% = level 3)
service: fan.set_percentage
target:
  entity_id: fan.berbel_fan
data:
  percentage: 66
```

### Light Control
```yaml
# Turn on top light with 75% brightness and warm white
service: light.turn_on
target:
  entity_id: light.berbel_light_top
data:
  brightness_pct: 75
  color_temp: 370  # Warm white

# Turn on both lights
service: light.turn_on
target:
  entity_id: 
    - light.berbel_light_top
    - light.berbel_light_bottom
```

### Automation Examples
```yaml
# Turn on lights when cooking
automation:
  - alias: "Kitchen Hood Lights On"
    trigger:
      platform: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.kitchen_motion
      to: 'on'
    action:
      service: light.turn_on
      target:
        entity_id: 
          - light.berbel_light_top
          - light.berbel_light_bottom
      data:
        brightness_pct: 80

# Auto fan when high humidity
automation:
  - alias: "Kitchen Hood Auto Fan"
    trigger:
      platform: numeric_state
      entity_id: sensor.kitchen_humidity
      above: 70
    action:
      service: fan.set_percentage
      target:
        entity_id: fan.berbel_fan
      data:
        percentage: 66  # Level 2
```

## üîß Advanced Services

The integration provides additional services for advanced control:

### `berbel.set_immediate_refresh`
Control immediate status updates after commands (for performance tuning):
```yaml
service: berbel.set_immediate_refresh
data:
  enabled: false  # Disable for better performance
```

### `berbel.disconnect_ble`
Manually disconnect BLE connection (useful for troubleshooting):
```yaml
service: berbel.disconnect_ble
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Ensure the range hood is powered on and within Bluetooth range
- Check that no other device is connected to the range hood
- Try restarting the Bluetooth service: `sudo systemctl restart bluetooth`

### Performance Issues
- Disable immediate refresh: Use `berbel.set_immediate_refresh` with `enabled: false`
- Check for interference from other Bluetooth devices
- Ensure stable power supply to the range hood

### Debug Logging
Add to your `configuration.yaml`:
```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.berbel: debug
```

## üß© Legacy (older models)

Some older Berbel hoods (e.g., advertising as HOOD_PER) use a different BLE protocol than the Skyline Edge Base. A decompiled vendor app (see template/sources/com/cybob/wescoremote/utils/Hood.java) shows:

- Different GATT Services/Characteristics:
  - Service (legacy): 52017769-797c-4cdd-9ff7-628b4eae5c9f
  - Service (2018 variant): eb0ebe81-7dd6-489c-b0fc-2ede8e9c37fe
  - RX characteristic (write ASCII): 58f49d41-c83e-4e5d-afe6-f3257c56effa
  - RX characteristic (2018): 00a12d11-2172-4aae-869e-777e169ea742
  - TX characteristic: 204c70ff-3227-4c46-a862-59d9f201b272
  - Config characteristic: 51a6bb05-25ce-40a4-b184-c91afbb4327e
- Commands are URL-encoded ASCII strings prefixed by a 4-digit PIN (default 1234), e.g. 1234 + cmd_off / cmd_luft1 / cmd_nachlauf etc.
- State is primarily broadcast via manufacturer data in BLE advertisements (not via the same GATT characteristics this integration uses).

What‚Äôs implemented now
- Detection scaffolding: The integration can detect legacy devices by name/UUIDs and will avoid using the modern binary protocol on them.
- Constants for the legacy UUIDs and default PIN are included in custom_components/berbel/berbel_ble/const.py.

What‚Äôs still needed to fully support legacy models
1) Command mapping
   - Map Home Assistant actions (fan levels, lights, postrun) to the app‚Äôs cmd_* ASCII commands (see template R.java for identifiers).
   - Write URL-encoded bytes of "PIN + command" to the RX characteristic.
2) State parsing
   - Implement a passive advertisement parser to decode manufacturer data like Hood.java does (extract fan level, flags for lights, postrun, etc.).
   - Update BerbelBluetoothDeviceParser to accept that data shape.
3) Optional pairing PIN setting
   - Add a config option to override the default PIN (1234).

Until 1) and 2) are implemented, legacy devices will show a clear log message and won‚Äôt attempt to control via the modern protocol (to prevent errors).
